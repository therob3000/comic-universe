I am a huge comic book fan and wanted to try my hand at a cool visualization that would give comprehensive information on comic book heroes and villains. This project is my attempt to use D3.js and Topojson,js to create an interactive visualization. 

After working on the visualization, I realized that this could be used for many other data sets (sports teams, political elections, etc). So my goal is to modularize the code so that the producer or developer can change the data and get a different visualization based on that data. 

My second goal is to move from static json files to utilizing node and a NoSQL database like MongoDB so data can be added, deleted, and modified by a user on the server side. 

This project utilizes Bootstrap 3.0, jQuery, D3.js, Topojson.js, and Underscore.js. This is an example of my chart and map works, as well as Underscore templating. 

This map projection and working maps can be viewed at http://rtodd.net/comic-universe/universe_marvel.html and http://rtodd.net/comic-universe/universe_dc.html.
